# Lead-Scoring
An education company named X-Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Now although X Education gets a lot of leads,its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example if they say they acquire 100 leads in a day,only about 30 of them are converted.
Goals
1. X Education needs help to select the most promising leads i.e the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
2. The company requires help to build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such
that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
